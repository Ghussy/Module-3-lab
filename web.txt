**How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? **


The url is split into 3 different components. the path, the name, and the protocol/schema (ie http).
When you click on a link, on a high level, it makes a connection to the server. your system will construct a request to a DNS server.
 To find the address. If youve never clicked on it before, the request is sent. If you have clicked it before, you might be able to skip that. 
After you get your response, you now know what address you have to send packets to with over that connection. 
You can then send a request. Your browser will interpret the response, and start rendering the page.
